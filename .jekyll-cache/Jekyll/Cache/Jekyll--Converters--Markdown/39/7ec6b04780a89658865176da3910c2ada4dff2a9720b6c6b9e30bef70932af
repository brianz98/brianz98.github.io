I"U<p>I am Brian, a third-year student at the University of Cambridge studying Chemistry under the Natural Sciences course.</p>

<p>My long-term goal is to develop multiscale simulation systems to effectively and efficiently harness the power of computational methods to shed light on the most important questions in life - protein (mis)folding, atmospheric chemistry, to name a few.</p>

<p>In the short run however I’m primarily focussed on getting the basics right, which means stuff like electronic structure theory, and its limits, which you’re gonna see a fair bit of ramblings on in by <a href="https://brianz98.github.io/blog/">blog</a></p>

<p>Over my three years of undergraduate education I’ve done the following courses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First year (2018, Part IA, first class)
    <ul>
      <li>Chemistry</li>
      <li>Physics</li>
      <li>Biology of Cells</li>
      <li>Mathematics B</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Second year (2019, Part IB, unclassed due to COVID, received a college scholarship usually for first class students, based on internal rankings)
    <ul>
      <li>Chemistry A (theoretical)</li>
      <li>Chemistry B ((in)organic, biological)</li>
      <li>Pharmacology</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Third year (Chemistry, 2020, Part II)
    <ul>
      <li>See more on the details of each course <a href="https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/teaching/course-guides">here</a></li>
      <li>Core courses on (in)organic, spectroscopy; theory, preparative, physical and theoretical practicals; chemical informatics</li>
      <li>Elective courses on
        <ul>
          <li>Biological: biological catalysis (B3), proteins (C5), nucleic acids (C9)</li>
          <li>Organic (B2, C5)</li>
          <li>Theory: statistical mechanics (B4), group theory (B7), perturbation theory (C7), electronic structure theory (C8)</li>
          <li>Others: organometallic catalysis (B1 part 2), atmospheric chemistry (B4), physical chemistry (C11)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Further modules on scientific programming in Python, mathematical methods, extended theoretical practicals</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
