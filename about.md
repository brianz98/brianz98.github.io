I am Brian (Zijun if you can manage that), a third-year student at the University of Cambridge studying Chemistry under the Natural Sciences course. 

My long-term goal is to develop multiscale simulation systems to effectively and efficiently harness the power of computational methods to shed light on the most important questions in life - protein (mis)folding, atmospheric chemistry, to name a few. 

In the short run however I'm primarily focussed on getting the basics right, which means stuff like electronic structure theory, and its limits, which you're gonna see a fair bit of ramblings on in by [blog](https://brianz98.github.io/blog/).

Over my three years of undergraduate education I've done the following courses:

- First year (2018, Part IA, first class)
	- Chemistry
	- Physics
	- Biology of Cells
	- Mathematics B
- Second year (2019, Part IB, unclassed due to COVID, received a college scholarship usually for first class students, based on internal rankings)
	- Chemistry A (theoretical)
	- Chemistry B ((in)organic, biological)
	- Pharmacology
- Third year (Chemistry, 2020, Part II)
	- See more on the details of each course [here](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/teaching/course-guides)
	- Core courses on (in)organic, spectroscopy, theory; preparative, physical and theoretical practicals; chemical informatics
	- Elective courses on 
		- Biological: biological catalysis (B3), proteins (C5), nucleic acids (C9)
		- Organic (B2, C5)
		- Theory: statistical mechanics (B4), group theory (B7), perturbation theory (C7), electronic structure theory (C8)
		- Others: organometallic catalysis (B1 part 2), atmospheric chemistry (B4), physical chemistry (C11)
	- Further modules on scientific programming in Python, mathematical methods, extended theoretical practicals
